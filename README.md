# PasswordGenerator
A Password Generator app is a tool designed to create secure, random passwords to enhance online security. With the increasing number of online accounts and the need for strong, unique passwords, such an app is invaluable in helping users generate passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.
# Key Features
# 1. Customizable Password Criteria
# Length: Users can specify the desired length of the password, typically ranging from 8 to 128 characters.
# Character Types: Users can choose which types of characters to include in the password:
Uppercase Letters (A-Z)
Lowercase Letters (a-z)
# Numbers (0-9)
*Special Characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, )
# 2. Random Generation
Randomization Algorithm: The app uses a robust randomization algorithm to ensure the generated passwords are unpredictable and unique each time.
# 3. User Interface
Simple Input Fields: Fields or sliders for users to input their desired password length and select character types.
Generate Button: A button to initiate the password generation process.
Display Area: An area where the generated password is displayed, with options to copy it to the clipboard.
# 4. Security Features
Strength Indicator: A visual indicator or score that shows the strength of the generated password based on length and character complexity.
No Storage: The app does not store generated passwords, ensuring they remain private and secure.
# Implementation Overview
# 1. User Interface Design
The UI is typically designed using a framework like JavaFX for desktop applications, or HTML/CSS for web applications. The main components include:

Input Fields: For specifying password length and selecting character types.
Buttons: To generate the password and copy it to the clipboard.
Display Area: To show the generated password and its strength.
# 2. Password Generation Logic
The core functionality involves generating a password based on user-defined criteria:

Character Pool Creation: Based on selected options, a pool of characters is created from which the password will be randomly constructed.
Random Selection: Characters are randomly picked from the pool until the desired password length is reached.
Strength Calculation: An algorithm to assess the strength of the generated password.
